Tips
For making Homemade Cake, make sure you whisk the cake mix well. And better use an electric blender for mixing all the ingredients, as this will make the mixture frothy and light.
If you do not have butter at home, you can even use clarified butter or ghee. Or you can use homemade white butter for extra flavour.
